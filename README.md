Welcome to the InstaPostViewer-JavaFX-Project! This is a JavaFX application that allows you to browse Instagram account images using RapidApi Instagram-looter. You can easily search for any Instagram account by its username and view its pictures using the app.

In addition to displaying images, the app also provides information about the account, such as the number of followers and bio. Furthermore, each post provides detailed information about the location, likes, and other relevant data.

In addition to its Instagram browsing features, InstaPostViewer-JavaFX-Project also includes a secure login/register system to protect user data.

This feature enhances the app's privacy features, providing an added layer of protection for users.
